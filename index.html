      <h2>Celebration</h2>
      <p>
        Everything kicks off with our wedding ceremony at 3pm. After that, we
        will head out for pictures as a newlywed couple while our guests make
        their way to our reception hall for refreshments. We will rendezvous
        at the reception hall for dinner to get the party started.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner, we are inviting an additional group of close friends to
        join for dessert, drinks, and dancing!
